		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>The glorious pepperoni pizza prized by Ohio established company, Donatos.
			This pizza is a thin crust pizza with a generous amount of pepperoni and cheese.
			It leaves you mouth watering and wanting more. The best part, it's easy to share with friends and family.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>Here's a recipe that will make 30 oz of dough, which is enough for two 14" pizzas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>19.67 oz Flour</li>
			<li>6.88 oz Water</li>
			<li>2.12 oz Egg (I think this was one whole egg.)</li>
			<li>1 tsp ADY</li>
			<li>1.94 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>0.69 oz Oil</li>
			<li>1.61 tsp Sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Equipment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Special equipment you'll need for this pizza:</li>
			<li>A kitchen scale that measures in ounces.</li>
			<li>A 14" perforated aluminum coupe-style pan, seasoned.</li>
			<li>Dough docker (but a fork will suffice).</li>
			<li>Pizza wheel.</li>
			<li>Baking stone (optional but recommended).</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<h4>Prepwork</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Measure the appropriate quantity of yeast (1 tsp) and put it in your mixer bowl.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate quantity of 110-degree water (6.88 oz) and pour about 2 oz of it into the mixer
				bowl.</li>
			<li>Add a pinch of sugar to the yeast water.</li>
			<li>Stir the yeast water and sugar together and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate quantity of flour (19.67 oz) and add it to the mixer bowl.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate quantity of salt (1.94 tsp) and add it to the flour.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate quantity of sugar (1.61 tsp) and add it to the flour.</li>
			<li>Use a wire whip or spoon to incorporate salt and sugar into the flour.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate amount of egg (2.12 oz, or 1 egg) and set aside.</li>
			<li>Measure the appropriate amount of oil (0.69 oz) and set aside.</li>
			<li>Check the yeast water. If it is foamy, it means the yeast is alive and hydrated, so move on to the next
				step. If the yeast water is not foamy, wait 5 minutes and check again. After you check the yeast again,
				go ahead and move on to the next step, even if the yeast water is not foamy. (The yeast is probably
				fine, but be aware that if the yeast water has not become foamy, it may mean your yeast is dead. So if
				your pizza ends up showing no sign of fermentation, buy some new yeast and try again.)</li>
			<li>Add the rest of the water to the mixer bowl.</li>
			<li>Add the rest of the ingredients to the mixer bowl.</li>
			<li>Place the mixer bowl in its place on the mixer and attach the dough hook.</li>
			<li>Mix the dough for about 5 minutes, or until all the ingredients are distributed evenly throughout the
				dough.</li>
			<li>Divide the dough into two pieces, with one of the dough pieces weighing about 16 oz.</li>
			<li>Give each piece of dough a few kneads and round them into dough balls.</li>
			<li>Let the dough balls rest at room temperature for two hours, covered or in a bag.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>After Dough Rests</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Set the smaller dough ball aside.</li>
			<li>Use your hands to flatten the larger dough ball, in preparation for for rolling the dough.</li>
			<li>Roll the piece of dough with a rolling pin until the dough is slightly larger than 14". Try not to use
				much flour while rolling the dough, and try to keep the dough as circular as possible.</li>
			<li>When the dough is just larger than 14", place your 14" pan atop the dough.</li>
			<li>Using a pizza wheel (pizza cutter), trim the dough around the circumference of the pan.</li>
			<li>Remove the excess dough and weigh the dough skin. At this point, the weight of the dough skin should be
				around 14.62 oz. But if it's still heavier than that, continue rolling and trimming until the dough skin
				weighs about 14.62 oz.</li>
			<li>When you've trimmed the dough skin down to about 14.62 oz, sprinkle a little cornmeal on your work
				surface and place the dough skin atop the cornmeal. Also, place the dough scraps under the second dough
				ball (because you'll need this dough to make the second dough ball weigh enough to make another 14"
				skin.)</li>
			<li>Roll the dough skin lightly, until it is slightly larger than the 14" pan (because the skin will shrink
				back down to about 14").</li>
			<li>Once you feel confident that the skin will not shrink to smaller than 14", dock the dough with either a
				docker or a fork.</li>
			<li>If you will only be making one pizza today, find a way to cover both the top and bottom of the skin with
				plastic wrap. (Since you won't be using this skin for at least a day, you want to make sure the skin
				does not dry out in the refrigerator.)</li>
			<li>Put this skin in the refrigerator. Keep it flat, if possible.</li>
			<li>Repeat Steps 2-9 with the second dough ball.</li>
			<li>Spray your perforated pan with nonstick spray (optional). Here is a pic of how your seasoned pan should
				look:</li>
			<img src="../img/alumPan.JPG" alt="aluminum pan">
			<li>Place the skin atop the pan, with the cornmeal side of the dough as the bottom of the skin.</li>
			<img src="../img/doughPan.JPG" alt="dough on pan">
			<li>Spray the top of the dough skin with nonstick spray.</li>
			<li>Leave the skin at room temperature for at least a couple hours before assembling a pizza.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Assembling Pizza</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Add 8 oz of sauce to the top of the dough skin.</li>
			<li>Pick up the pan and tilt it so the sauce flows to the edge of the skin.</li>
			<li>As the sauce reaches the edge of the skin, turn the pan almost like a steering wheel and let the sauce
				flow along the edge of the skin until the sauce covers the entire skin, from edge to edge.</li>
			<li>Add 7.68 oz of provolone (or mozzarella) to the sauced skin, from edge to edge. If you are making a
				cheese pizza, add a
				little more cheese (because when you order a cheese pizza at Donatos, you're actually ordering an extra
				cheese pizza,
				which is why a cheese pizza costs the same as a 1-topping pizza). I don't know exactly how much is the
				right amount of
				cheese for extra cheese. Probably another 2 oz or so.</li>
			<li>If you're making a pepperoni pizza, add 4.8 oz of pepperoni (or 0.300 lbs). If you plan to use more
				toppings than just
				pepperoni, use 3.52 oz of pepperoni (or 0.220 lbs). (The topping weights I've listed here are the exact
				weights they use
				at Donatos. If I did not list a weight, it's because I don't know what the weight should be. Even though
				I listed a
				weight for the dough skin, I don't know the exact weight of a 14" Donatos dough skin. However, I do know
				the weight I
				listed is very close.)</li>
			<li>Just before you put the pizza in the oven, shake a mixture of romano cheese and oregano over the top of
				the pizza. My
				memory tells me this mix should be about 80% romano and 20% oregano. Or maybe 75/25.</li>
			<li>Bake at 500 until the cheese and toppings look like they're done. If the toppings are done but the crust
				is not done,
				remove the pan and allow the pizza to finish baking directly on the stone for another minute or two.
			</li>
			<li>When the pizza is finished, use a peel or a cookie sheet to remove the pizza from the oven.</li>
			<li>If you made a cheese pizza or a 1-topping pizza, use 5 cuts by 2 cuts (as shown below). If you topped
				with more than one
				topping, use 4 cuts by 2 cuts.</li>
			<li>Eat.</li>
