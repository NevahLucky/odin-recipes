		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>A foodies go to seaside sandwich combines the firm container of its wheat with the
			melting sweetness of coastal shrimp, oysters, and/or clams lathered in a refreshing sauce. The Po'Boy
			originated in 1929 in the Martin Brothers' French market restaurant.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Shrimp: You will need fresh or frozen and thawed peeled and deveined 16/20 or 26/30 shrimp.</li>
			<li>Bread: Classic New Orleans-style French bread is used. Feel free to use my recipe or pick it up near the
				deli at most grocery stores.</li>
			<li>Egg: A few eggs go into the batter for the shrimp.</li>
			<li>Milk: I prefer to use buttermilk. However, regular whole milk can be used.</li>
			<li>Seasoning: My Cajun seasoning recipe works excellently, or you can use your favorite homemade or
				store-bought version.</li>
			<li>Mustard: Stone ground or Creole mustard works fantastic in the marinade for the shrimp.</li>
			<li>Sauce: Traditionally, mayonnaise is used, but I used Cajun Remoulade for more complementing flavors.
			</li>
			<li>Flour: All-purpose flour is needed for the batter.</li>
			<li>Cornmeal: Plain cornmeal is used in the batter.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Peel, devein and rinse the shrimp.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the Cajun seasoning, mustard, hot sauce, buttermilk, and eggs until
				combined.</li>
			<li>Add in the shrimp and mix well until coated. Let marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>In the meantime, prepare the lettuce, tomato, and dill pickles.</li>
			<li>Pour some oil into a large frying pan and heat to 350°.</li>
			<li>Add the flour, cornmeal, Cajun seasoning, and salt to a casserole-size pan and whisk until combined.
				Taste it to make sure it’s seasoned enough.</li>
			<li>Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and add a handful to the pan with the flour-cornmeal mixture.
				Toss very well to make sure it is coated on all sides.</li>
			<li>Set aside on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper and repeat the process until all the shrimp have
				been coated in the batter.</li>
			<li>Set the shrimp on a sheet tray with a rack to drain excess oil. Repeat the process with the remaining
				half of the battered shrimp.</li>
			<li>Spread some butter on each half of the sliced French bread.</li>
			<li>Toast the bread butter side down on a flat top or in a pan over low to medium heat until brown and
				toasted.</li>
			<li>Place some lettuce down on the bottom toasted slices of bread.</li>
			<li>Next, evenly spread the tomatoes and pickles.</li>
			<li>Place on as many shrimps as you can.</li>
			<li>Spread a generous helping of the mayonnaise or remoulade on the top slice of bread and then add it to
				the top of the sandwich.</li>
